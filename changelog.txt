dev version - 16/12/2015
------------------------------
* code clean up
* function keys to the VM
	- trace implemented - now disassemble and status windows only update on trace mode
		on trace mode the disassemble window will follow the pc;
	- new disassemble implemented - function key to force another disassemble of
	the memory state.
* refactored IO thread to support new function keys. vm input is totally
separated from program input

dev version - 15/12/2015
------------------------------
* refactored curses.c for code readability
* threaded IO - a thread that delegates the io to the vm or the program being run
* curses interface - work in progress - looking pretty so far
